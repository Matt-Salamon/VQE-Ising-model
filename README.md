# VQE-Ising-model
Codes and data for a summer project on applying the Variational Quantum Eigensolver algorithm to the transverse-field Ising model.

## Contents
Folder "jupyter_codes" contains .ipynb notebooks in which the code for the project was developed. Most of these should be quite well documented within the notebboks themselves.
Folder "runtime_scripts" contains a .py script that was used to run the simulations on real IBM Quantum hardware via the Qiskit Runtime framework.
Folder "plots" contains an incomplete collection of plots that were produced during the project using the Jupyter notebooks included here.
Finally, there is a final presentation and a final report, which should explain the project.
